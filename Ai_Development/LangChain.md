âš¡ **Rule of thumb**:

* If you see **`ChatXXX`** â†’ use it when the provider supports chat-style APIs.
* If just **`XXX`** (no "Chat") â†’ itâ€™s for plain text completions.
* If **`XXXEmbeddings`** â†’ itâ€™s for embeddings.

Popular Built-in Tools in LangChain

Estimated time: 5 minutes

LangChain offers a variety of built-in tools designed to enhance AI agent capabilities across search, coding, web browsing, productivity, and more. These tools work seamlessly with language models, allowing for dynamic task execution. This guide explores popular tools and toolkits categorized by use case, including notes on availability and pricing.

In this reading, you will identify key built-in tools and toolkits available in LangChain and understand the purpose and function of each tool within its use case category. You will also compare multiple search and data analysis tools to determine their ideal applications and evaluate whether a tool requires payment or is freely accessible based on official documentation.
Tools and toolkit

Tools are utilities designed to be called by a model: their inputs are designed to be generated by models, and their outputs are designed to be passed back to models.

A toolkit is a collection of tools meant to be used together.

One thing to keep in mind is that some tools may be paid and some free. It is advised that check if the tool is free or not on the official documentation.

Summary

In this reading, you learned that:

    LangChain integrates tools and toolkits to extend the functionality of language models across diverse use cases such as search, data analysis, web browsing, and productivity.

    Each tool serves a specific functionâ€”for example, SerpAPI performs web searches, while the Python REPL executes code for data analysis or automation.

    Toolkits group related tools (for example, SQL Database Toolkit or Gmail Toolkit), enabling more complex task orchestration within a single interface.

    Some tools are free, and others require payment. Always verify the pricing and availability through the official documentation before integration.

    Use case-specific tools (for example, Tavily for AI-optimized search or MultiOn for web app interaction) help tailor LangChain applications to real-world business or research needs.
